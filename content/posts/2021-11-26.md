What model? Empennage or whole kit? $2500 or $30,000? 88 pounds or 1138 pounds? Paid in full or down payment? Do I have room to store it all?

Buying an airplane kit requires a lot of decisions and a fair bit of planning. The most important being: what company sells what you are looking for, what do you need, and what materials are you comfortable working with; slightly less important is what do you want. There is of course, the often forgotten question: how much storage space are you able to use?
