### Why I chose the Van&rsquo;s Aircraft RV-7

The Van's Aircraft website has a page to help determine which aircraft is right
for you. A lot of the questions are not about what you want, but what you need.
Following this tree I ended up with a single airframe that fit my mission; I
will describe my decision tree here.

### How many seats do you _need_?

* One: RV-3
* Two: RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-9/9A, RV-12is, RV-14/14A.
* Four: RV-10

One seat is undesirable to me as I want to travel with passengers occasionally,
and I have no _need_ for four seats.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-9/9A, RV-12is,
RV-14/14A.

### Do you _need_ aerobatic capability?

* Yes: RV-3, RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-14/14A
* No: RV-9/9A, RV-10, RV-12is

While I have no intention of flying competition aerobatics, the ability to move
freely in three dimensions is something that I do want.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-14/14A.

### Tandem or Side-By-Side?

* Tandem: RV-3, RV-4, RV-8/8A
* Side-By-Side: RV-7/7A, RV-9/9A, RV-10, RV-12is, RV-14/14A

Tandem is very much pilot and passenger, I want a pilot and co-pilot
arrangement.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-7/7A, RV-14/14A.

### Conventional or Tricycle?

* Conventional: RV-3, RV-4, RV-7, RV-8, RV-9, RV-14
* Tricycle: RV-7A, RV-8A, RV-9A, RV-10, RV-12is, RV-14A

This is entirely personal preference, conventional gear for me.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-7, RV-14.

### Private Pilot or Light Sport?

* Private: RV-3, RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-9/9A, RV-10, RV-14/14A
* Light Sport: RV-12is

Private pilot, because I am one.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-7, RV-14.

### Removable wings?

* Non-Removable: RV-3, RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-9/9A, RV-10, RV-14/14A
* Removable: RV-12is

I have no need to remove the wings.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-7, RV-14.

### Tip Up Canopy, Sliding Canopy, or Doors?

* Tip Up: RV-7/7A, RV-9/9A, RV-12is, RV-14/14A
* Sliding: RV-3, RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-9/9A
* Doors: RV-10

Another personal preference, I don't need doors, and I like sliding canopies
more.

_Airframes that fit the mission_: RV-7.
