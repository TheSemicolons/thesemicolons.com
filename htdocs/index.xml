      <description>Why I chose the Van’s Aircraft RV-14 The Van’s Aircraft website has a page to help determine which aircraft is right for you. A lot of the questions are not about what you want, but what you need. Following this tree I ended up with a single airframe that fit my mission; I will describe my decision tree here.
How many seats do you need?  One: RV-3 Two: RV-4, RV-7/7A, RV-8/8A, RV-9/9A, RV-12is, RV-14/14A.</description>
